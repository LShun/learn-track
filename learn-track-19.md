## March 2019

1. **Started logbook**
2. **From Statistics 1 in TARUC:**
   1. Learned Bayes' theorem, stem & leaf plot. *Honestly those are cool*
   2. Solved a problem involving finding the size of set given the number of combinations. *Spent an hour on it but when you solved it, oh yes!*
3. **From Web Development in TARUC:**
   1. Learned more of the frameworks for developing websites *Doing 20 hours worth of work in 2 hours is hilarious*
   2. Figured out that the `_` (underscore) symbol does NOT work well as a filename for Javascript files when building a website using Flask. *Can't find any reason but might be a Flask/Jinja/Python quirk since it works with normal HTML files*
   3. Learned a lot of cool CSS tricks involving pseudo-elements (using `::`) and pseudo-selectors (using `:`). *Sticky navigation bar is by far my favourite*
4.  **From How to Code: Simple Data:**
    1.  Found out about how precompiled binaries can dramatically speed up execution time *Sucks to add 1 to 1 and need 10 seconds*

That's all for this month, I'm looking forward to the next!
